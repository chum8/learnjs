	The code below demonstrates several ways to use for loops to check for conditions.  Lesson 18 implemented a boolean flag as well.
	<pre>
var matchFound = "no"; //This is a flag.  It will tell us if a condition was met.
var cityToCheck = "Anaheim";
var cleanestCities = ["Dallas", "L.A.", "New York", "Anaheim", "San Antonio"];

for (var i = 0; i <= 4; i++); {
	if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[i]) {
		matchFound = "yes"; //Changes the flag to "yes" because the condition was met.
		alert("It's one of the cleanest cities");
		break; //We found the cleanest city, so we can simply break out of the loop.
	}
}
if (matchFound === "no") {
	alert("It's not on the list");
}

var matchFound = false; //This is a Boolean flag.
for (var i = 0; i <= 4; i++); {
	if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[i]) {
		matchFound = true;
		alert("It's one of the cleanest cities");
		break;
	}
}
if (matchFound === false) {
	alert("It's not on the list");
}

var numElements = cleanestCities.length; //What if you don't know the array length?  Use .length to find out.
var matchFound = false;
for (var i = 0; i <= numElements; i++); { 
	if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[i]) {
		matchFound = true;
		alert("It's one of the cleanest cities");
		break;
	}
}
if (matchFound === false) {
	alert("It's not on the list");
}
